3. **Quadratic Application:**
An engineer designs a projectile that follows the path described by $$y = -5x^2 + 30x + 25$$, where \(y\) is the height in meters and \(x\) is the horizontal distance in meters. Find the maximum height reached by the projectile.

4. **Algebraic Manipulation:**
Simplify the expression: $$\(\frac{3x^2 - 2x + 5}{x^2 + x - 6} \cdot \frac{x^2 - 9}{2x^2 - 3x - 2}\)$$.

5. **Engineering Context - Beam Stress:**
The stress, $\(\sigma\)$, in a beam under uniform loading is given by \(\sigma = \frac{My}{I}\), where \(M\) is the moment, \(y\) is the distance from the neutral axis, and \(I\) is the moment of inertia. Solve for \(y\) if \(\sigma = 120\) MPa, \(M = 300\) Nm, and \(I = 600\) cm\(^4\).

6. **Solve the Quadratic Equation by Completing the Square:**
Solve for \(x\): \(x^2 - 6x + 8 = 0\) by completing the square.

7. **System of Equations in an Engineering Scenario:**
An electrical circuit consists of resistors \(R_1\) and \(R_2\) in parallel, with total resistance \(R_t\). Given \(1/R_t = 1/R_1 + 1/R_2\) and \(R_t = 6\) ohms when \(R_1 = 10\) ohms, find \(R_2\).

8. **Algebraic Expressions - Factorization:**
Factor the expression completely: \(4x^2 - 16x + 16\).

9. **Quadratic Equation - Engineering Application:**
A water tank's outflow rate in liters per minute is modeled by the equation \(R = 100 - 10t + t^2\), where \(t\) is the time in minutes since the valve was opened. Find the time when the outflow rate will be 75 liters per minute.

10. **System of Equations with Three Variables:**
 Solve the system for \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\):
 ```
 x + 2y + z = 7,
 2x - y + 3z = 3,
 3x + y - z = 0.
 ```
